Inspired by clangmoyai's IINA plugin. I added more cross platform support. <br>
It is tested fully in windows 11 environment. Hopefully it will work in others. <br>

* The script will add a simple "Play" button for each scene card. You click on it, and the video get played.<br>
You click on the video, then it will disappear. You are back to the scene list. <br>
* To install it, copy and paste the code from the pwPlayer.js into Stash->Settings->Interface->Custom Javascript.<br>
Then refresh the browser.
* Well, it's supposed to be this simple. Don't know why Stash guys make it so complicated. <br>
So, enjoy play with it. In the future I will try to make it work with DeoVr.
